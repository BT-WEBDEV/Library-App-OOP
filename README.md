# Library-App-OOP

Please note - this is the same program as my previous desktop library application except it has been re-tooled to use object oriented programming. 

Case Use: Simple desktop library application project built in Python to store book information. It does have a GUI using Tkinter. The Library App stores the following book information to a database: Title, Author, Year, & ISBN. The user can view all books, search for books, add books, update book information, and delete books.

Modules Used:

Tkinter

PLEASE READ THIS FIRST - The repository contains two primary script files a "BACKEND.PY" & "FRONTEND.PY". I've gone ahead and included all other files from my project including my virtual environment and database with a few books stored.

To Run The Script:

Make sure you have tkinter installed.

Run the Python script "frontend.py" from your terminal.

Once the script has run, the desktop GUI should appear and be running.
